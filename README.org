Emacs TypeScript Servcie library: a midde-level library between TypeScript
Services and Emacs.

This project grows out of [[https://github.com/carltonf/emacs-tss][my fork]] of [[https://github.com/aki2o/emacs-tss][aki2o/emacs-tss]], completely rewritten with
a focus on re-usability. Many Emacs utilities are factored out as independent
projects basing on =etss=.

ease running tests.

If you want to run the tests:

or
